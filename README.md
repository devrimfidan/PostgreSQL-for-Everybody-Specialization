# PostgreSQL for Everybody Specialization

I've created this space **for learning purposes only**, based on the **PostgreSQL for Everybody Specialization** by **Dr. Charles Russell Severance (Dr. Chuck)** on Coursera.

## Specialization Overview

Through this specialization, I explore SQL (Structured Query Language) and database design principles. I cover fundamental SQL syntax, working with single and multiple tables, and designing databases with one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. With hands-on exercises and practical examples, I develop the skills needed to effectively interact with and manage relational databases.

## Learning Objectives

By the time I complete this specialization, hopefully I will be able to:

- Write basic SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data.
- Design and create database tables.
- Understand and implement one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.
- Work with real-world datasets.
- Apply database design principles to solve practical problems.
