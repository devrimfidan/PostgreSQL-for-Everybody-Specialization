# PostgreSQL-for-Everybody-Specialization

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to SQL (Structured Query Language) and database design principles.  We will cover fundamental SQL syntax, working with single and multiple tables, and designing databases with one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.  Through hands-on exercises and practical examples, you will gain the skills necessary to effectively interact with and manage relational databases.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into four modules:

*   [Module 1: Introduction to SQL](module-1-introduction-to-sql.md)
*   [Module 2: Single Table SQL](module-2-single-table-sql.md)
*   [Module 3: One-To-Many Data Models](module-3-one-to-many-data-models.md)
*   [Module 4: Many-To-Many Data Models](Module-4-many-to-many-data-models.md)

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this course, you will be able to:

*   Write basic SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data.
*   Design and create database tables.
*   Understand and implement one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.
*   Work with real-world datasets.
*   Apply database design principles to solve practical problems.

## Prerequisites

No prior experience with SQL or databases is required.  A basic understanding of computers and file management is helpful.

## Software

We will be using PostgreSQL as our database management system.  Instructions for installing and setting up PostgreSQL will be provided in Module 1.
