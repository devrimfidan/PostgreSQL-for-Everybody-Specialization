# COURSE:2 INTERMEDIATE POSTGRESQL

## Module 1: SQL Techniques
In the first week, I will dive into SQL commands that go beyond the basics of adding, reading, updating, and deleting data. I'll start by learning how to modify tables and columns in PostgreSQL. For instance, I will get hands-on experience with creating stored procedures, which are basically reusable pieces of code that can make managing databases easier. I’ll also be exploring the `SELECT DISTINCT` command, which is helpful when I want to retrieve only unique values from a table.

## Module 2: Using SQL Techniques
In this week, I will focus on working with real data. I'll be learning how to convert CSV files into tables that are well-structured (this is called normalization). I'll also explore the `ALTER TABLE` command, which allows me to change the structure of a table after it’s been created—whether it's adding a new column, changing data types, or setting constraints. This week is all about taking raw data and transforming it into something useful.

## Module 3: Text in PostgreSQL
The focus this week is on handling text in PostgreSQL. I will be exploring how PostgreSQL works with text data, such as storing it, searching through it, and even indexing it for faster retrieval. I'll be learning how to work with character sets and how to use algorithms to identify things like hashtags in text. This will help me understand how text is processed, stored, and retrieved in the most efficient way possible. It’s about making sure that text-related operations are fast and effective.

## Module 4: Regular Expressions
The last week will take me into the world of regular expressions. Regular expressions are a powerful tool for searching text based on patterns. For example, I’ll learn how to search through a database for rows that match certain patterns—like finding all email addresses or phone numbers in a list. I’ll be getting hands-on experience with constructing regular expressions to match different types of data, making it a very practical skill for querying databases effectively.
